Regiment Room Manager


In a constantly evolving society, the French Army must equip itself with equipment that optimizes management. It is therefore natural that RRM comes to help the weeks of the different squadrons, by offering them real-time monitoring of room occupancy, as well as date tracking and problems that have occurred in order to focus financial needs on real needs to solve technical problems. RRM will help to streamline the flow of transit rooms and ensure a better quality of service.
